#	Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol Implementation (java)
- Flooding: Each node sends Link State Advertisement packets to their neighbors for certain period.
- Shortest Path: Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to compute the shortest path in the current network.
- Routing Table: Based on the shortest path algorithm, determine the routing table for every node.
